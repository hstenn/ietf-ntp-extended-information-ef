    <abstract>
      <t>The network packet format used by NTP has changed very little
	between NTPv1, defined by <xref target="RFC0958">RFC 958</xref> in
	1985, and NTPv4, defined by <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>.
	The core network packet used by NTP has no spare bits available for
	reporting additional state information and no larger data areas
	available for larger amounts of information.  This proposal offers a
	new extension field that would contains this additional
	information.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The core NTP packet format has changed little
	since <xref target="RFC0958">RFC 958</xref> was published in 1985.
	Since then, there has been demonstrated need to convey additional
	information about NTP's state in an NTP packet, but no
	backward-compatible way to usurp the few otherwise potentially
	available bits has been found, and no larger data areas are
	available in the core packet structure.  This proposal offers a new
	extension field that would contain this additional information.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
